    <p>
      3.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The customer may only set-off, reduce or clear a claim by the hotel with a claim which is undisputed or decided with final, res judicata effect.</p>

    <p>

    <p>
      5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the hotel is entitled to effect extraordinary withdrawal from the contract for a materially justifiable cause, in particular if</p>

    <p>
      -&nbsp;&nbsp; the purpose or the cause of the stay is illegal;</p>

    <p>
      7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insofar as a parking space is provided to the customer in the hotel garage or a hotel parking lot, this does not constitute a safekeeping agreement, even if a fee is exchanged. The hotel only assumes liability for loss of or damage to motor vehicles parked or manoeuvred on the hotel’s property and the contents thereof only pursuant to the preceding No.&nbsp;7.1, sentences 1 to 4.</p>
    <p>
      7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wake-up calls are carried out by the hotel with the greatest possible diligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      Messages, mail, and merchandise deliveries for guests shall be handled with care. The hotel will deliver, hold, and, for a fee, forward such items (on request). The hotel only assumes liability according to the preceding No. 7, sentences 1 to 4.</p>

    <p>
      8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For commercial transactions the place of performance and payment as well as, in the event of litigation, including disputes for checks and bills of exchange, the exclusive court of jurisdiction is at (Hamburg, Bremerhaven or Schwerin). Insofar as a contracting party fulfills the requirements of section 38, para. 2 of the German Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) and does not have a place of general jurisdiction within the country, the courts at (Hamburg, Bremerhaven or Schwerin)shall have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>
      8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contract is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with German law. The application of the UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods and Conflict Law are precluded.</p>
    <p>
